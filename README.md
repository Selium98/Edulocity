# Edulocity

Edulocity is a completely working and live website where students can subcribe and view a variety of courses and can learn from the modules 
and units present in the course. An option for a instructor to put his/her courses on the website has also been provided. The instructor 
can create a new course as per his/her expertise. To do that, first he/she needs to sign up as a teacher on the website and then can put 
videos, modules, units of the course on the site. The courses include both paid and free courses. 

For the paid courses, two payment options have been integrated : 
  1. Paypal  
  2. Razorpay

The students can view the courses according to their convinence. Once the course is completed along with all the quizez provided, an 
E-Certificate is issued to the students. The certificate is available only if all the modules are viewed.
